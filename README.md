Description
A polyline in 3D is given by the list of nodesâ€™ coordinates. Implement an algorithm that
searches the nearest point on the polyline to any given point. In case of multiple solutions,
output all of them.
Input-output
The algorithm should be framed as a console application:
1. Input (command line options):
- name of text file containing coordinates of polyline nodes,
- coordinates of the point to be projected.
2. Output:
- number of found solutions
- print the indices of all nearest polyline segments and coordinates of corresponding
projection points.
